# Noted!
A WIP task management app built for epic noting far beyond the transparency and capabilities of the likes of Sticky Notes.

- [x] More than a Checkbox
- [x] It's a life!
- [ ] Is sticky notes good?
- [x] Creating tasks since 2023.

To download the newest but not completely stable version, go to the site: https://noted-kcf.w3spaces.com/. Just simply download it from there and follow the steps in the txt after extracting, pretty straightforward. This will install the app. The above link is the official website that I designed. Not the most modern but it's something.

### NOTED IS A WIP APP AND NOT ALL THE FEATURES WILL WORK RIGHT AWAY. I WILL UPDATE THE LINK EVERY TIME I COMPLETE A VERSION. I TRIED UPLOADING HERE BUT I JUST GET A LARGE FILE SIZE ERROR.
